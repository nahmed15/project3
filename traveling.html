            <p>I think this video not only describes how much I love to travel but also other things I like to do.Traveling is not only for buying plane tickets but also for road trips, long drives, and much more. I remember earlier this year, I traveled to Ohio from Chicago, I was so excited about my road trip and enjoyed every bit of it. Even though I had to go to some other place in Chicago the next day but I didn't wanted to miss this road trip too. So yeah, I forgot everything and went like this moment won't come again in my life. I got tired but it was worth it.</p>
